Citing and giving a shoutout to Ben Eater (https://www.youtube.com/@BenEater) for building and providing a kit of the World's Worst Video Card. I built a low quality graphics card that uses a VGA cable and port to generate a low resolution pixelated image on a monitor. It uses a 10 MHz oscillator. I had a lot of fun with this.
